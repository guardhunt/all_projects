A Regular Computer

Installation and use instructions:
To run this program, your computer needs to have a text editor that can
read and compile HTML, CSS, and PHP, and javaScript codes, and your machine needs to be connected
to a database as well. Your database need to have a table that holds emails
and password in a "users" table. You will need to enter the email and the password for
authentication.
You will also need another table that holds student ID numbers, in order to access
online forms and fill them out, the system will ask for a student ID.
Also, remember to match the name of your localhost, database name and password in the
database connection.
